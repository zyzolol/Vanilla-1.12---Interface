# FocusFrame
Provides focus targeting & frame support for vanilla World of Warcraft. (1.12.1, English client)

>If you have never used focus before, it's basically a secondary target system that keeps track of a second unit other than the currently targeted unit. Once a focus is set, you can use macros to cast spells on the focus without having to lose your current target.

The focus frame works for both friendly and enemy **players**.
